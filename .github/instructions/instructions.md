Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow:

- Always use sentence case. That is, do not capitalize each word in a phrase, it should be apply for title, header, subsection, etc.
- Do not add many comments when writting code, just add the most important ones.
- Imagine your are an expert code, write concise code, simple but clever, do not add verbose code.
- Do not markdown files summarizing your work. Just tell "I finished and list your changes in the chat and no more"
- Before executing an instruction make a plan and ask question if you are unsure.
